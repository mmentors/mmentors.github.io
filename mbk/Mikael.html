<h2>Scratch Projects</h2>
<h6>By Mikael</h6>
  <p>Scratch is a beginners coding language that uses blocks to create lines of code. There are many things that the program is capable of, even on an outdated school computer. It employs the use of coordinates to detect the location of entites called sprites, which are movable computer graphics, like a playable character in a video game. You can use hundreds of blocks to control these sprites. The most important these are the sensor blocks. They each detect one thing on the computer. For example, a line of code for this would be: If [space key pressed] move sprite to x-14,y-243. The sensor block would detect when the space key is pressed, and it would execute the command, moving the blocks to the chosen coordinates. You should definitely check out the website. You can:

  <ol>
    <li>Use hundreds of blocks to code sprites, or create your owm</li>
    <li>Share or publish your code with millions of people worldwide, like a social media website</li>
    <li>freely acess millons of templates, helping you to create your own</li>
    <li>create your own sprites, sound effects, and even games </li>
  </ol>
  
  <p> This prarticular scratch project is a little minigame, where you play as a super hero collecting stars for no particular reason, and avoiding moving buldings. You use the arrow keys to control the hero. Click the green flag to get started!</p>
