			<p><h3>In hardware,we opened computers and took all the parts out,
			such as the hardrive, motherboard, and the DvD rom. Later we did posterboards about hardware. I did the motherbard and the hardrive. The motherboard holds all the hardware in place. And the hardrive stores all the data for work and games.	</h3><p>
