My favorite things to do is,one helping people out with problems they are having trouble with or helping them in situation's their in.
For example:My next door neighbors were doing some cleaning so I asked if they needed some help with the heavy garbage they had they said sure that I could help.
They gave me some gloves and I started helping them.
Another thing I like to do is play sports.One of my favorite sports is soccer,I am training to play on a team its fun to play soccer you have to try a sport.
You don't do better from doing nothing practice everyday it helps you to improve.
My favorite subject is social studies and ELA. I love reading because its easier than math and science.
I like social studies because its easier than science but not math,some people might say this problem is easy but I don't really understand math the problem was 12-9+c=12.
My favorite game is minecraft pe,it allows me to build and explore my imagination.Minecraft helps me get rid of stress i have but for other people thats not the case.
I go to a after school program its my best decision I've made.
The after program is called stem/morrison mentors its the program that is showing me how to make this.I am in 6th.
